      <h1>👋 Hey there — I’m Aryan Maheshwari</h1>
      <p>
        Even before I could write full sentences, I was the kind of kid who unscrewed remote controls just to “see how they worked.” That curiosity didn’t fade—it evolved. Today, I’m a builder in AI with a keen eye for impactful, scalable solutions—shaped by a strong foundation in data science, real-world experience, and a love for collaborative innovation.

    <!-- About -->
    <section>
      <h2>🎓 A Journey Rooted in Learning</h2>
      <p>
        My academic path began at K.J. Somaiya Institute of Technology, where I earned my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science with a specialization in Blockchain. <br><br>
        Currently, I’m pursuing my M.S. in Applied Data Science at the University of Southern California, applying everything I’ve learned in cutting-edge research and real-world systems.

    <!-- Research -->
    <section>
  <h2>📄 Research</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve authored two research papers:
    <br>
    – <a href="https://example.com/blockchain-election-paper" target="_blank">
      <em>Blockchain-Based Election Systems</em>
    </a>
    <br>
    – <a href="https://example.com/ai-in-industry-paper" target="_blank">
      <em>AI in Industry</em>
    </a>
    <br><br>
    Research taught me how to ask deeper questions, evaluate rigor, and communicate ideas effectively.
