      <h1>👋 Hey there — I’m Aryan Maheshwari</h1>
      <p>
        Even before I could write full sentences, I was the kind of kid who unscrewed remote controls just to “see how they worked.” That curiosity didn’t fade—it evolved. Today, I’m a builder in AI with a keen eye for impactful, scalable solutions—shaped by a strong foundation in data science, real-world experience, and a love for collaborative innovation.

    <!-- About -->
    <section>
      <h2>🎓 A Journey Rooted in Learning</h2>
      <p>
        My academic path began at K.J. Somaiya Institute of Technology, where I earned my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science with a specialization in Blockchain. <br><br>
        Currently, I’m pursuing my M.S. in Applied Data Science at the University of Southern California, applying everything I’ve learned in cutting-edge research and real-world systems.

    <section>
      <h2>🚀 Projects</h2>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>📚 Hierarchical Text Retrieval & QA System (RAPTOR + MILVUS)</h3>
        <p>I engineered a textbook-scale retrieval pipeline using RAPTOR indexing, Gaussian Mixture summarization, and GPT-3.5 Turbo. I designed a hybrid retrieval stack (BM25, DPR, SBERT) for scalable QA over 300+ page documents.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>💊 Toxicity Prediction Pipeline</h3>
        <p>A robust pipeline for drug toxicity prediction using SMILES. Powered by FastAPI, Celery, XGBoost, Redis/PostgreSQL, and DVC. I led backend development and model tracking with MLflow.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>🕹️ Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Arm Control</h3>
        <p>Trained a PPO agent in Gymnasium with MuJoCo physics and Apple MPS acceleration. Added live logs, video playback, and evaluation dashboards. Future: STL logic integration.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>🔬 Tumor Classification from Histopathology</h3>
        <p>Binary classification of IDC vs. non-IDC using ResNet-18 + Grad-CAM. Later extended with DCGANs for synthetic augmentation. Streamlit frontend for usability.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>🎮 GridWorld with Tabular Q-Learning</h3>
        <p>Custom RL environment with multi-goal navigation, partial observability, and stochastic actions. Animated agent trajectories to study exploration vs. exploitation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>✍️ Blog Generator using LLaMA 2</h3>
        <p>AI-powered web app using CTransformers + LLaMA 2 to generate personalized blogs via Streamlit. My first dive into prompt engineering and user-centric UI.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>💼 Experience</h2>

      <div class="experience">
        <h3>🎯 USC Summer Research Intern — Sports Simulation Engine</h3>
        <p>Led 8 interns building a FIFA-style simulation engine. Designed a hybrid AI + logic-based roster system, reducing lineup errors by 40% and improving match consistency.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="experience">
        <h3>🚗 USC Autodrive Lab — AI Research Intern</h3>
        <p>Worked on autonomous driving modules and DRL-based policy learning with PPO/SAC. Deployed transformer models on CUDA systems, improving training runtime 4x.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="experience">
        <h3>🤖 AGIE AI — Generative AI Intern</h3>
        <p>Built a WhatsApp chatbot (Dialogflow + Vertex AI) and a GPT-powered startup research matcher. Improved data flow latency by 23%.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Research -->
    <section>
      <h2>📄 Research</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve authored two research papers:
        <br>– <em>Blockchain-Based Election Systems</em>
        <br>– <em>AI in Industry</em>
        <br><br>
        Research taught me how to ask deeper questions, evaluate rigor, and communicate ideas effectively.
