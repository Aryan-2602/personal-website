    <h1>👋 Hey there — I’m Aryan Maheshwari</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">
      Even before I could write full sentences, I was the kind of kid who unscrewed remote controls just to “see how they worked.” That curiosity didn’t fade—it evolved. Over time, it matured into a deep passion for building intelligent systems that can understand, learn, and make decisions...

    <h2>🎓 A Journey Rooted in Learning</h2>
    <p>My academic path began at K.J. Somaiya Institute of Technology... <br>Currently, I’m pursuing my M.S. in Applied Data Science at the University of Southern California...</p>

    <h2>🚀 Building Things That Learn, Adapt, and Scale</h2>
    <ul class="project-list">
      <li><strong>📚 Hierarchical Text Retrieval & QA System</strong><br>I engineered a textbook-scale, hierarchical retrieval pipeline using RAPTOR indexing...</li>
      <li><strong>💊 Toxicity Prediction Pipeline</strong><br>In this ongoing project, I’m building a robust AI pipeline for predicting drug toxicity endpoints...</li>
      <li><strong>🕹️ RL for Robotic Arm Control</strong><br>I trained a PPO agent to control a Fetch robotic arm in Gymnasium...</li>
      <li><strong>🔬 Tumor Classification from Histopathology</strong><br>Using transfer learning (ResNet-18), I built a binary classifier to distinguish IDC vs. non-IDC cancer patches...</li>
      <li><strong>🎮 GridWorld with Tabular Q-Learning</strong><br>This custom GridWorld had multiple goals, partial observability, and noisy actions...</li>
      <li><strong>✍️ Blog Generator using LLaMA 2</strong><br>This AI-powered web app allows users to generate personalized, high-quality blogs...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💼 Experience Beyond the Classroom</h2>
    <ul class="project-list">
      <li><strong>🎯 USC Summer Research Intern — Sports Simulation Engine</strong><br>I led a team of 8 interns in developing a FIFA-style simulation system...</li>
      <li><strong>🚗 USC Autodrive Lab — AI Research Intern</strong><br>I’m working on autonomous driving modules using PPO/SAC and CUDA acceleration...</li>
      <li><strong>🤖 AGIE AI — Generative AI Intern</strong><br>I designed a WhatsApp chatbot and a GPT-based insight matcher for startups...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📄 Research, Writing & Inquiry</h2>
    <p>I’ve authored two research papers:<br>
    - <em>Blockchain-Based Election Systems</em><br>
    - <em>AI in Industry</em><br>
    Research taught me how to ask deeper questions, evaluate rigor, and communicate ideas effectively.</p>

    <h2>🧠 How I Work</h2>
    <p>I build with care and curiosity. Whether I'm training a model, designing a system, or leading a team—I bring:<br>
    - A passion for learning and experimentation<br>
    - The discipline to ship reliable solutions<br>
    - The mindset of an excellent teammate and leader<br>
    If you're building something meaningful in AI, I’d love to collaborate.</p>
